This a custom R\-O\-O\-T library that provides a framework for physics analysis. It contains several functions and classes that aid in analyzing high energy physics data. To aid in the compilation of all the source code, a macro entitled {\ttfamily Compile\-Source.\-C} can be executed from the command line. All functions and classes are available in python from the {\ttfamily lib/\-H\-A\-L.\-py} module. Furthermore, everything lives in the 'H\-A\-L' namespace. H\-A\-L stands for\par
